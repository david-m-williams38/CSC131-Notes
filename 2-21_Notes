MVP - minimal viable project

Startup Weekend - Techstars Startup Weekend Rocklin (HackerLab Rocklin)

Chapter 1-3 MUST BE READ :)



DUE MARCH 6TH - 13 DAYS - 150 POINTS

::Project Sprint3::

Using Jar Files in our workflow

Using branches, merge, etc:
Have a running release branch (Main)
Then have a development branch

Summary:
Min Max Avg
Time calculations on a particular task size

Get data out of summary for Sprint3



Rename a task

java TM rename <Old Task> <New Task>

think about how it should be implemented, what part to edit first
	Seems like he is saying either to read log or write log file first

	Read text file, delete old log, then recreate old log
	OR
	look for rename command then handle the data later

It is valid to rename the task, then create a new task with the same old name

	Probably better to edit the log file so the program doesn't have
		to keep track of each task as it reads the log file

java TM delete <Task Name>

	Summary before delete or rename, it should NOT come up in the summary

	Keep track of tasks' delete, start, stop, rename, etc.
	It should function naturally

Make choices about the behavior YOU want

(disallow it in the future) <- Prof thinks it is a bad thing to do
	Not a good solution to disallow the task name, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN
		IT NOT FUNCTIONING

Packages/Jar files next week
	Handle how to create a jar file
	+
	How to import/create packages, how the structure works/is implemented


class TM
	Broken into two classes
	TM + TMModel

	Easier to refactor with the split packages

DON'T HAVE TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB FOR TURN-IN
BUT
It is required to submit a git.log


If we rename a task to a task that already exists:
	start starters
	stop starters
	start food
	stop food
	~~~~~~~~~~~~
	rename food salad
	start salad
	stop salad
	start food
	rename starts FOOD

Two approaches:
	Combine them?
	^Could get messy due to how many cases of a task there might be

	OR

	***Prompt user that it is "not allowed"
	***Merge command??
	***(Prof thinks this is a better solution for us rn)


New workspace? Throw some things away
Talk in groups??

Only 1 DON'T PRINT AVG :P

No need to print min/max/etc with only 1 item/task

TM appmain/main class/etc

WILL BE GONE OVER FRIDAY AS WELL!


Public Class TMModel implements ITMModel

Class TM - interacts with user, have a Main()

(he will have class TMGrader, ONLY CONNECTS TO TMModel)

Refactor code, he said that A LOT today...








Software Architecture (Lecture 4):


Definition of Software Architecture

Decisions + Key Concerns

Styles

Views

Problem vs Solution Structure



"Don't reinvent the wheel" - find somebody else's "wheel"

decoupling systems - OUR PROJECT TM to TM + TMModel

Separation of Concerns
	Decomposition, Implementation, etc.


Software Architecture:
	A set of High Level decisions that determine the structure of 
		the solution

Architectural styles....

System Scope

A decision is ''architectural' if it can be made only by considering the
	present scope

Strong alignment with the business strategy**

System composition
	How do we break the system up into pieces...
	all of the pieces
	fit together??

Cross-cutting concerns
	Broad-scoped qualities or properties of the system
	tradeoffs among the qualities

Conceptual integrity

Software arch. provides a set of WELL-KNOWN SOLUTIONS that are proven
	to work for similar problems
