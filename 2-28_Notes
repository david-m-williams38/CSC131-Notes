IF multiple choice, choose BEST ANSWER, more than one answer might be correct
	ONLY 1 choice will get you the point, but it HAS to be the best

Backwards Compat is important :)

WWW -	REST (Representational State Transfer)

Unix shell script architectural style:
	Pipe-and-Filter

Client/Server

Central Repository (database)

Layered (or Multi-Tiered)

Peer-to-Peer

Model-View-Controller (MVC)!!

^^^^
Should know about the above!



Componenets
	Processing elements that "do the work"

Connectors
	Enable communication among components
		Implicit events, explicit (procedure calls), etc...
		(events will be taught more later)
		REVISITING THIS LATER

Interfaces
	Connection points on the components and connectors

Configurations
	Arrangements of components...



Model-View-Controller

Model -		holds all data, state, and application logic. Oblivious
			to the view and controller. Provides API to retrieve
			state and send notifications of the state changes
			to "observer"

View -		Gives user a presentation of the model

Controller -	Takes user input and figures out what it means to the model


(Observer pattern may be looked at later)

Event Interpreter!!

Standard in + Standard out (<cmd> | <cmd>...)

state of domain model

Model visualizer

Domain model

Know and understand these terms

State of the visual feedback may need to change
	(EX: In excel, go to formula window, type a formula, and hit the
		ENTER key on THAT window, that cell now has a different
		model. It might recompute the whole spreadsheet.
		Old data/Old news from the previous cell to this new formula)


Patterns will be in CSC 133
